## Project title
Sentient

## Research Question
What new forms of dialogue could be built between public and movies if both would become sentient of each other?

## Description
Sentient is an interactive installation that invites the audience to engage with cinema in a unique and introspective way. Using modular wooden cubes, each featuring small openings that reveal film excerpts on embedded screens, the installation encourages curiosity-driven exploration. The selected scenes focus on introspective moments, where characters are immersed in thought. However, when a viewer comes too close, the characters acknowledge their presence—pausing their actions and staring directly at the spectator. The result is an unsettling yet thought-provoking experience that blurs the line between observer and observed, prompting reflection on cinema’s voyeuristic nature and our relationship with on-screen narratives.

 ## User Journey
- **Curiosity Sparked:** Upon entering the installation, visitors notice a collection of wooden cubes arranged in a modular format. Some cubes are solid, while others feature small holes, hinting at something hidden inside.

- **Discovery:** Peering into these openings, visitors find small screens displaying scenes of introspective moments from various films.

- **Immersive Engagement:** As they continue watching, they become drawn into the emotions of the characters. However, as they approach too closely, an unexpected shift occurs.

- **Disrupting the Narrative:** The characters within the films detect the viewer’s presence, suddenly breaking their immersion and turning to gaze directly at the spectator, holding their attention until the visitor steps away.

- **Reflection:** Visitors are left with a lingering sense of self-awareness and the uncanny feeling of being watched, mirroring the dynamics of cinema’s voyeuristic experience.
